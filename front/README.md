# front
_fromt_ was created by ```create-react-app front```
The following node modules are added.

* npm install --save @material-ui/core
* npm install --save redux
* npm install --save react-redux
* npm install --save isomorphic-unfetch
  
The following modules are used in the tests.
* pip install flask flask_cors
  
## Quick Start

1. cd to front/src directory
2. (only once) run ```npm install``` to restore packages defined in package.json
3. yarn start -> browser opens and goes to http://localhost:3000
4. open another shell -> cd to src/tests/fake
5. run ```start_fake_nodes.sh```
6. play with GUI. After clock 3, you can see node state changes
7. when finished, run ```stop_fake_nodes.sh```
 
## Development Status

* Features
  * Config
    * Node count and port: done
  * Actions
    * Get Status: Not Implemented. Should talk to all nodes to get status.
    * Clock:
        * Reset/Increment/Decrement clock: Set in _state_, but not propagated
  * Status
    * Node status (idle/broadcasting block...): Not implemented
    * Node status (internal blockchain and transaction pool): Not implemented
    * Animation: Not Implemented
  * GUI
    * First version: done with simple material-ui
    * Second version: fancier ui not implemented yet
* Unit Test
  * Not implemented. Plan to have fake nodes to run with.

## Original README generated by create-react-app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
